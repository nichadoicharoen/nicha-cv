The LinkGen project addresses a critical issue found on public bulletin boards and during events, where QR codes are often displayed to share important information from the hospital. However, malicious actors may create fake QR codes that mislead those who scan them, potentially damaging the hospital's reputation and the integrity of its services. To counter this, LinkGen provides a secure solution to generate standardized, hospital-specific QR codes and short links. These links are unique to the hospital, ensuring authenticity and traceability. Additionally, LinkGen offers features for creating, editing, tracking, and setting expiration dates for links, providing full control over shared information and enhancing security for both the hospital and its users.
