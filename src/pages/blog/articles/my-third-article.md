IFPTrack offers a comprehensive solution for tracking infusion pumps, allowing staff to monitor each pump's statusâ€”whether it's in use, idle, or under maintenance. The system also displays the department responsible for each device and its current location, addressing the frequent issue of missing or hard-to-locate pumps. Often, staff struggle to find available pumps or need to make numerous calls to track down who has one to borrow. With this solution, staff can simply scan the pump's unique QR code to update its usage status, streamlining the process significantly. This information not only saves time but also provides valuable data to improve future asset management and streamline hospital operations.
