KidCare is a web application designed specifically for digital-age parents, bringing the traditional vaccination record book to mobile for added convenience. With KidCare, parents can easily keep track of their child's vaccination schedule, add new records if they receive vaccines elsewhere, and ensure that their child never misses an important vaccination. The app includes a reminder feature that sends alerts for upcoming appointments and allows parents to view their child's appointment history at any time. Additional features, such as recommended articles and doctor suggestions, are also available, with more helpful tools planned for future updates.
